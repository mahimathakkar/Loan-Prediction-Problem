# Loan-Prediction-Problem
• Developed a binary classification model for Automation of the loan eligibility process based on customers' data. • Analyzed all the features through statistical analysis (both univariate &amp; multivariate) using graphical and numeric methods to select useful and significant features. Data cleaning methods were used in removing the outlier and also in computing the missing values. • Developed and compared different models based on their accuracy scores using different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forests. Parameter tuning was also done for all these models. • An accuracy score of 79% was finally obtained using Logistic Regression based model.
